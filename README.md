# Automobile Analytics: Electric Vehicles (EVs)

## Problem Area

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of first-generation electric vehicles (EVs) and their charging infrastructure. It aims to identify challenges and opportunities to make next-generation EVs more efficient and adding more charging stations. The project affects current EV owners, potential buyers, automakers, and the environment.

## Solution Proposal

We will use data science techniques, including regression analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling, to analyze datasets related to EV performance and charging infrastructure. This analysis will uncover critical factors affecting user satisfaction, vehicle efficiency, and areas requiring improvement. We'll also assess the current availability and optimal placement of charging stations based on user demand.

## Potential Impact

This project could drive significant changes in the EV sector, promoting sustainable and efficient mobility solutions. By improving next-gen EVs,  it may increase adoption, expansion of the charging stations, reduce CO2 emissions, and stimulate economic growth.

## Dataset

Datasets may include performance statistics of various EV models, charging times, optimizing and expanding EV charging infrastructure to facilitate widespread adoption, user feedback, and total cost of ownership. The project will adapt to available datasets for relevance and feasibility.
